# CALHM2 Depletion Effects on Cellular Lipidome

## Overview
This project investigates the impact of CALHM2 gene knockout on cellular lipid profiles, with a focus on understanding its potential implications in cardiovascular disease pathways. Advanced data science techniques including web scraping and natural language processing (NLP) are employed to analyze lipid functions and associations with diseases.

## Key Data Science Elements
- **Web Scraping:** Extracted data from PubMed and HMDB websites for lipid descriptions and abstracts.
- **NLP Analysis:** Utilized TF-IDF and WordCloud techniques to identify key lipid functions and associations with diseases within abstracts.
- **Unit Testing:** Ensured reliability of web scraping functions for abstract retrieval.
- **Error Handling:** Implemented exception handling to manage potential errors in web scraping and data processing.
- **Visualization:** Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing lipidomics data and trends.
- **Data Processing:** Processed lipidomics data for analysis, including filtering, normalization, and statistical testing.
